# Bundle

This bundle is part of [elcodi project](https://github.com/elcodi).
Elcodi is a set of flexible e-commerce components for Symfony2, built as a
decoupled and isolated repositories and under
[MIT](http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT) license.

# Overview

The CartCouponBundle provides all the tools needed to manage cart-coupons relationships
in your Symfony2 projects.

You can see this bundle working on the [Bamboo] project to manage coupons, both
manual and automatic, into the cart.

# Installation & Configuration

You can install this Bundle the same way you will do with any other [Symfony]
bundle, you'll find info on this [symfony documentation page][4]

In a few words, you can use [Composer] to install the bundle getting the package
from
[elcodi/cart-coupon-bundle packagist](https://packagist.org/packages/elcodi/cart-coupon-bundle)
by just executing the following line

``` bash
$ composer require "elcodi/cart-coupon-bundle:~0.5.*"
```

You can also do it manually by adding a line in your `composer.json` file

``` json
{
    "require": {
        "elcodi/cart-coupon-bundle": "~0.5.*"
    }
}

```

After that you'll have to enable the bundle on your `Appkernel` file.

``` php
<?php
// app/AppKernel.php

// ...
class AppKernel extends Kernel
{
    // ...

    public function registerBundles()
    {
        $bundles = array(
            // ...

            // Add this bundle
            new \Elcodi\Bundle\CartCouponBundle\ElcodiCartCouponBundle(),

            // Required dependencies
            new \Elcodi\Bundle\CartBundle\ElcodiCartBundle(),
            new \Elcodi\Bundle\CouponBundle\ElcodiCouponBundle(),
            new \Elcodi\Bundle\CoreBundle\ElcodiCoreBundle(),

            // Optional dependencies
            new \Elcodi\Bundle\RuleBundle\ElcodiRuleBundle(),

            // ...
        );

        // ...
    }

```
